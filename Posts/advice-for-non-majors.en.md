"Isn't it too late to start now?"
"As a non-CS major, can I ever catch up to computer science graduates?"

These are the most common questions I hear from those dreaming of a career transition into development. I fully understand the fear that comes with embarking on a new challenge. However, today I want to share a slightly different perspective with you.

## 1. Age is Not Just a Number, But the 'Depth of Experience'

Many people feel embarrassed or anxious about learning to code at a later age. Compared to CS majors in their early twenties, it's true that your start might be later. But while they were coding, **you were learning about the world.**

Development is ultimately 'the act of solving problems'. The countless problem-solving processes, communication skills, and patience you've gained through your professional life are just as crucial as coding ability for a developer. Don't be deterred by your age. Your age isn't a late start; it signifies a wealth of accumulated experience.

## 2. Don't Hit the 'Reset' Button

Let me tell you a bit about my own journey. I double-majored in **Business Administration and Big Data Business Administration at Seoul National University of Science and Technology.** I cultivated both liberal arts and engineering aptitudes, which might seem distant from development.

When I formally began studying development at **SSAFY (Samsung SW Academy For Youth)**, I too felt anxious, wondering if I'd fall behind as a non-CS major. There were times I thought I needed to furiously code and study algorithms, erasing my past self to be reborn as a 'pure developer.'

However, when I was assigned to develop an **internal groupware** in practice, I realized something. My past learning in **MIS (Management Information Systems)** was far from useless.

*   How are an organization's decision-making structures formed?
*   Why should approval workflows be designed in a certain way?
*   In what form should data be presented to management to be valuable?

Someone who solely focuses on coding might implement 'functions,' but with a business administration background, I could understand **'the rationale behind business logic'** and implement it effectively. The MIS I learned in university permeated every line of code, becoming the driving force behind creating a more efficient and user-friendly system.

## 3. Your Career is About 'Accumulation,' Not 'Replacement'

What I really want to emphasize is: **don't discard your existing background; build your development skills upon it.**

If you worked in an accounting team, you can combine your accounting domain knowledge with development to become a 'FinTech specialist developer.' If you worked in a logistics center, you can become a 'logistics system developer' who best understands the challenges on the ground.

Competing purely on coding ability against a CS major who has studied computers for four years is a tough path. But when **[your domain knowledge + development capability]** are combined, you will carve out a unique position that no one else can replace.

Development is not an end in itself; it is a **tool**. Add this powerful tool to your unique story. Only then will you become an irreplaceable developer.

> **Tip**: Take another look at your resume right now. That one line you thought was 'irrelevant experience' and considered deleting might just be the weapon that makes you shine the brightest.
